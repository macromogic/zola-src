Howdy! This is Weijie Huang (黄炜杰, pronounces "*Way-Jee(-eh) Hwahng*").

I am a Ph.D. student in *Computer Science* at [Indiana University Bloomongton](https://bloomington.iu.edu), supervised by [Prof. XiaoFeng Wang](https://homes.luddy.indiana.edu/xw7).
I was previously a Ph.D. student at [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu) with [Dr. Nathan Dautenhahn](https://nathandautenhahn.com) advising me.
My research focuses on **system security** (*intra-process isolation*, *trusted execution environment*, *virtualization*, *capability model*, etc).
I am also interested in program analysis, LLM security, and high-performance computing.
I obtained my B.Eng. degree in *Computer Science and Engineering* at [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn) in 2022.
It was a great time working with [Prof. Fengwei Zhang](https://fengweiz.github.io).
