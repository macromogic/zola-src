Howdy! This is Weijie Huang (黄炜杰, pronounces "*Way-Jee(-eh) Hwahng*").

I am a Ph.D. student in *Computer Science* at [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu), previously advised by [Dr. Nathan Dautenhahn](https://nathandautenhahn.com).
My research focuses on **system security** (*intra-process isolation*, *runtime monitoring*, *virtualization*, *capability model*, etc).
Before entering Rice, I obtained my B.Eng. degree in *Computer Science and Engineering* at [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn) in 2022.
It was a great time working with [Prof. Fengwei Zhang](https://fengweiz.github.io).

I am learning to compose some music.

Collaborations are welcome.
