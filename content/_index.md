Howdy! This is Weijie Huang (黄炜杰, pronunces "*Way-Jee(-eh) Hwahng*").

I am now a Ph.D. student in *Computer Science* at [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu), advised by [Dr. Nathan Dautenhahn](https://nathandautenhahn.com).
My research focuses on **system security** (*intra-process isolation*, *dynamic program analysis*, etc).
Before entering Rice, I obtained my B.Eng. degree in *Computer Science and Engineering* at [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn) in 2022.

Please do not expect too much of computer science stuff in my posts. 
I would rather drop some math notes or random thoughts (occasionally, since I am not a good writer either).

I am learning to compose some music.
Check out my Bilibili (<i class="fa-brands fa-bilibili"></i>) account if you are interested.
Collaborations are welcome.
